# NatureIntelligence

The inherent intelligence present in and embodied by nature itself
A good example of this are the mycelial networks and growth patterns connecting and stabilising forests and larger ecosystems through nutrient and information exchange
The very process of growth and interaction in nature unavoidably carries a distributed intelligence with it that simultaneously constitutes and orchestrates a vast symphony of plant and animal life
